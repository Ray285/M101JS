MongoDB Notes:
--------------

What is MongoDB?
    -A non-relational (no tables) data store for JSON documents
    -JSON - JavaScript Object Notation ex: {"key": "value"}, {"name": "Raymond"}
    -No joins, or transactions in order to retain horizontal scalability (increasing commodity hardware)

Mongo Shell
    -Administrative shell written in C++ on top of V8 for performing admin tasks (checking config, running queries, etc.)
    -Makes request to MongoDB

Install / Download: www.mongodb.org/downloads

Starting MongoDB
    -Run "./mongo" this will start the mongo server from within the same directory
    -Runs on port 27017 by default

Synchronous vs Asynchronous
    -Mongo Shell is synchronous and will block all subsequent operations until the current operation completes
    -The NodeJS MongoDB client is asynchronous and will allow subsequent operations to proceed

Mongod server which listens for incoming connections to the MongoDB instance.
    -Expects BSON (Binary JSON)

Driver
    -library in a specific language that handles connecting to / communicating with MongoDB

Schema Design:
    -Embedding Sub-documents
    -Id references

    Considerations
        -A single mongodb document can not exceed 16MB
